This is the final project of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at http://www.theodinproject.com

The goal of this project is to build a basic Facebook clone using Rails. Users will be able to sign up for accounts, "friend" other users, create posts, comment on and like posts, and view their news feed populated with their and their friends' posts.
